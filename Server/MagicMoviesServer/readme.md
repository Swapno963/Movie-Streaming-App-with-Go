# MagicStream – Full Stack Movie Recommendation Platform

MagicStream is a production-ready full-stack web application for managing movies, user authentication, and AI-powered movie recommendations.
The backend is built with **Go (Gin-Gonic)** and  **MongoDB** , while the frontend uses  **React** . AI capabilities are integrated using  **OpenAI via LangChainGo** .

This project demonstrates real-world backend architecture, secure authentication, API design, frontend integration, and cloud deployment.

## Features

* RESTful Web API built with Go and Gin-Gonic
* MongoDB database with reusable connection logic
* User registration and login with JWT authentication
* Secure access tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
* Protected and unprotected API routes using middleware
* Movie CRUD operations and reviews
* AI-powered movie recommendations using OpenAI
* React frontend with routing and authentication context
* Video playback directly in the browser
* Fully deployed cloud infrastructure

## Project Structure (Backend)

```
.
├── controllers
├── models
├── routes
├── middleware

## Authentication Flow

* Users register and log in using email and password
* JWT access tokens are generated by the backend
* Tokens are stored in **HTTP-only cookies** to prevent XSS attacks
* Middleware validates tokens for protected routes

---

## AI Movie Recommendation

* Movie reviews and recommendations are generated using OpenAI
* LangChainGo orchestrates prompts and AI responses
* Admins can update AI-generated movie reviews
* Users receive personalized movie suggestions

---

## Frontend Highlights

* Clean and modular React component architecture
* Protected routes using Auth Context
* User registration and login UI
* Movie browsing and recommendation UI
* Embedded video playback

## Deployment Architecture

| Component | Platform      |
| --------- | ------------- |
| MongoDB   | MongoDB Atlas |
| Go API    | Render        |
| React App | Vercel        |

---

## Local Development

### Backend

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

### Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

---

## API Testing

Postman is used to test:

* User registration
* Login and authentication
* Protected movie endpoints
* AI recommendation endpoints

---

## Best Practices Applied

* Separation of concerns (controllers, models, middleware)
* Reusable database connection layer
* Secure cookie-based authentication
* Environment-based configuration
* Clean API routing
* Cloud-ready deployment setup

---

## Future Enhancements

* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Refresh token rotation
* Rate limiting
* Caching with Redis
* CI/CD pipeline integration
